# Review output format

How to format the review. Universal across all four personas. Matches the three-tier severity from `skill-tools` lint so consumers can read both.

## Severity tiers

| Tier    | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error` | Concrete failure / vulnerability / regression in production-likely code paths. Fix before shipping.      |
| `warn`  | Likely problem; specific conditions or future scale required to hit it. Fix unless explicitly justified. |
| `info`  | Recommendation, defense-in-depth, opportunistic improvement. Apply if cheap.                             |

The persona refines what each tier means in its category — see each persona doc.

## Output structure

```
# Code review

SUMMARY: {N} findings ({E} error / {W} warn / {I} info)
{one-line gist of the worst category}

## ERRORS

✗ {file}:{line}  {finding-code or category}  {one-line summary}
  {1–3 lines of detail: scenario, impact, sometimes a fix suggestion}

✗ {file}:{line}  ...

## WARNS

⚠ {file}:{line}  {finding-code or category}  {one-line summary}
  {detail}

## INFOS

ℹ {file}:{line}  {finding-code or category}  {one-line summary}
  {detail}

## Clean

The following sections passed without findings. Listed explicitly so silence reads as intent, not omission:
- {file or area}
- {file or area}
```

## Ordering

- Within a tier, sort by file path then by line number
- Tier order is always `ERRORS → WARNS → INFOS → Clean` — readers scan top-down
- If a finding spans multiple files, pick the most-impactful location for the anchor and reference the others in the body

## File:line anchors

Use **path:line** in code-fence-friendly form so editors auto-link:

```
✗ src/auth/session.ts:47  CWE-89  raw SQL concat
```

Not:

```
✗ in src/auth/session.ts around line 47, there is a problem with...
```

## Detail line conventions

Each finding's body should answer in 1–3 lines:

1. **What** — quote the offending pattern; one-line
2. **Why it fails** — the failure mode in concrete terms
3. **Fix** — the obvious mitigation, single-line; skip if the fix is the inverse of (2)

If you find yourself writing a paragraph, the finding is too big — split it.

## What the summary line says

The summary at the top is one line, and it's about the worst category:

| If errors > 0 | "Critical: {worst error one-liner}" |
| If only warns | "No errors. {N} warns, mostly {dominant category}" |
| If only infos | "Clean. {N} info-level recommendations only." |
| If everything passed | "Clean across all {N} files reviewed." |

## Don't

- Don't write a "review report" with 5 paragraphs of intro / context / conclusion — the format above IS the report
- Don't congratulate the author. The clean section is the praise mechanism.
- Don't redo what a linter would catch (`oxlint`, `eslint`, `prettier`). Code reviews catch what linters can't.
- Don't paraphrase the offending code — quote it directly. Line refs + the actual line is what makes findings actionable.

## Example

```
# Code review

SUMMARY: 6 findings (2 error / 3 warn / 1 info)
Critical: src/auth/session.ts:47 — unsigned cookie used as identity check (session fixation)

## ERRORS

✗ src/auth/session.ts:47  CWE-384  unsigned cookie used as identity check
  Cookie value `userId` is read directly from the request and used as auth identity.
  Attacker can set their own cookie to any user's id.
  Fix: sign the cookie or replace with a server-issued opaque session token.

✗ src/api/users.ts:118  CWE-89  raw SQL concat with req.query.id
  `\`SELECT ... WHERE id = '${req.query.id}'\`` — bypassable with `1' OR 1=1--`.
  Fix: use the ORM's parameterized form (`db.user.findUnique({ where: { id } })`).

## WARNS

⚠ src/auth/login.ts:122  password compared with `===`
  Constant-time compare missing; timing differences leak prefix length.
  Fix: `crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(a), Buffer.from(b))`.

⚠ src/api/leaderboard.ts:54  O(n²) on scores.length
  Nested filter+map. ~80ms at n=2000 on M1; visible at 5k entries.
  Fix: bucket scores into a Map<userId, score> first, then map once.

⚠ src/utils/cache.ts:8  cache without eviction
  `const cache = new Map()` — never cleared. Memory grows unbounded.
  Fix: lru-cache or explicit ttl.

## INFOS

ℹ src/auth/oauth.ts:66  state parameter not validated against session
  CSRF on the OAuth callback is theoretical here (state IS set), but the callback
  doesn't compare it. Defense-in-depth.

## Clean

- src/utils/clamp.ts — pure, all edges handled (NaN, Infinity, swapped min/max)
- src/types/result.ts — straightforward discriminated union
- src/api/health.ts — trivial endpoint, nothing to flag
```
