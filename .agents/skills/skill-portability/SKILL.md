name: skill-portability
description: >-
  This skill should be used when the user wants to check whether an agent
  skill is portable across providers. Common triggers include "is this skill
  cross-provider safe", "will my skill work in cursor", "audit skill
  compatibility", "check if this loads in codex", and "which providers
  support this skill". Spawns one agent per provider in parallel against
  authoritative llms.txt docs and produces a compatibility matrix plus a
  COMPAT.md report. Skip when authoring a new skill (use skill-creator) or
  rerunning baselines (use skill-eval).

# skill-portability

Audits whether an agent skill loads and behaves correctly across the major
providers — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenAI Codex CLI, and the Agents-Skills
Baseline (covering Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Pi). See [`scripts/providers.mjs`](scripts/providers.mjs)
for the canonical list. The audit covers three layers:

1. **Format-level** — does the file/dir structure and frontmatter match what
   the provider expects?
2. **Body-level** — does the body reference provider-specific conventions
   (XML tags, headings) that other providers ignore?
3. **Tool-surface-level** — does the body name tools (e.g.,
   `AskUserQuestion`) that only exist in one provider?

The canonical provider list, doc URLs, and required/forbidden frontmatter
fields live in [`scripts/providers.mjs`](scripts/providers.mjs). The skill
reads from that script — never hardcodes provider details in the body — so
adding a new provider means updating one file.

## When to use

Verbatim trigger phrases:

- "is this skill cross-provider safe"
- "will my skill work in cursor"
- "will this load in codex"
- "audit skill compatibility"
- "check if this skill is portable"
- "which providers support this skill"
- "is my skill claude-only"

## When NOT to use

- Authoring a brand-new skill → use `skill-creator`
- Rerunning a skill's existing eval baselines → use `skill-eval`
- Linting a skill against this monorepo's rules → use `pnpm skill-tools lint`
- Comparing skill behavior across model versions → that's `skill-eval`, not this

## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS` — one of:

- A path to a skill directory (`skills/code-reviewer/` or
  `skills/skill-creator/`)
- A path to a single SKILL.md / .mdc / AGENTS.md file
- A glob (`skills/*`) — bulk audit
- A literal frontmatter+body block pasted into the prompt
- Empty — discover via `ls skills/` and ask which to audit

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the input

Determine what the user is auditing.

| Input              | Action                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directory path     | Read the SKILL.md (or .mdc / AGENTS.md) inside                              |
| Single file path   | Read the file directly                                                      |
| Glob               | Expand and audit each match                                                 |
| Pasted content     | Treat the prompt body as the skill content                                  |
| Empty `$ARGUMENTS` | List `skills/*/SKILL.md` and ask the user which to audit                    |

Parse the frontmatter (YAML between leading `---` markers) and remember the
body content. Both feed into the per-provider checks.

### 2. Load the canonical provider list

Run the bundled ESM script — no shell required, works on macOS, Linux, and
Windows:

```bash
node skills/skill-portability/scripts/providers.mjs --pretty
```

Capture the JSON. Each entry has `id`, `name`, `fileFormat`, `fileLocation`,
`docUrls`, `requiredFrontmatter`, `optionalFrontmatter`, `ignoredFrontmatter`,
`forbiddenFrontmatter`, `toolSurface`, and `notes`.

This script is the single source of truth. Don't hardcode provider details
into the audit body — re-run the script each time.

### 3. Fan out: one agent per provider, in parallel

Dispatch one `Agent` call per provider returned by step 2 (concurrent — one
tool message with all tool uses). Don't hardcode the count — `providers.mjs`
is the source of truth and may grow. Each agent gets:

- The provider entry from step 2 (id, format requirements, docUrls,
  toolSurface, notes)
- The skill content from step 1 (frontmatter + body)
- These instructions to the subagent:

  > Fetch the first-listed `docUrls` entry via WebFetch (prefer `llms.txt` /
  > `llms-full.txt` over HTML when both are listed). If it 404s, try the next
  > URL. Then evaluate the skill against three layers:
  >
  > 1. **Format**: does it match `fileFormat`? Are all `requiredFrontmatter`
  >    fields present? Are any `forbiddenFrontmatter` fields present?
  > 2. **Body**: does the body lean on conventions this provider doesn't
  >    parse (e.g., XML tags Cursor strips, headings the baseline ignores)?
  > 3. **Tool surface**: does the body name tools not in this provider's
  >    `toolSurface`? List each unmatched tool name.
  >
  > Return a structured verdict:
  >
  > ```
  > VERDICT: compatible | partial | incompatible
  > FORMAT: <one-line summary>
  > BODY: <one-line summary>
  > TOOLS: <comma-separated unmatched tool names, or "none">
  > NOTES: <2–3 specific findings with file/line references where possible>
  > ```

Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (not `Explore` — Explore can't
WebFetch authoritative provider docs reliably). Run all dispatches in **one**
message so they execute concurrently.

### 4. Aggregate the verdicts into a matrix

Build a markdown table with one row per provider and one column per layer:

```
| Provider                | Verdict      | Format              | Body          | Tools          |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Claude Code             | compatible   | SKILL.md ✓          | clean         | -              |
| Cursor                  | partial      | needs .mdc          | XML stripped  | -              |
| OpenAI Codex CLI        | partial      | rename to AGENTS.md | clean         | Bash → shell   |
| Agents-Skills Baseline  | compatible   | SKILL.md ✓          | clean         | tool names vary |
```

Add a `NOTES` paragraph below summarizing the most actionable change to make
the skill more portable.

### 5. Write COMPAT.md and print the matrix inline

Two outputs:

- **Inline**: print the matrix + notes in chat so the user sees it immediately.
- **Persisted**: write `<skill-dir>/COMPAT.md` (or `./COMPAT.md` if no skill
  dir), containing: the matrix, the per-provider verdict bodies, the
  timestamp, and the `providers.mjs` `docUrls` actually fetched. The user can
  diff this over time to spot regressions when providers move docs.

For bulk audits (glob input), produce one combined matrix where rows are
skills, columns are providers, and write `COMPAT.md` at the repo root.

### 6. Handle stale URLs

If any subagent reports its `docUrls` all 404'd, surface this in the inline
output:

```
⚠ Stale provider docs for `cursor` — all 3 docUrls returned 4xx.
  Update scripts/providers.mjs or run `node scripts/providers.mjs --check`.
```

Don't silently fall back to guessing — bad provider data leads to bad
verdicts.

## Examples

<example>
<input>"is my code-reviewer skill cross-provider safe? it's at skills/code-reviewer/"</input>
<output>
1. Resolve: read `skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` → frontmatter has `name`,
   `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `model-invocable`. Body
   uses `<example>` blocks and references `AskUserQuestion`, `gh pr diff`,
   and a sibling `scripts/detect-clis.mjs`.
2. Load providers: `node skills/skill-portability/scripts/providers.mjs --pretty`
   → entries returned (currently 4).
3. Fan out one parallel `Agent` call per provider — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Agents-Skills Baseline.
4. Aggregate verdicts:

   | Provider                | Verdict      | Notes                                                              |
   | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Claude Code             | compatible   | native format                                                      |
   | Cursor                  | partial      | needs `.cursor/rules/code-reviewer.mdc`; references/ won't load    |
   | OpenAI Codex CLI        | partial      | rename to AGENTS.md; `AskUserQuestion` not in tool surface         |
   | Agents-Skills Baseline  | compatible   | loads from `.agents/skills/`; tool names vary per consumer         |

5. Write `skills/code-reviewer/COMPAT.md` with full per-provider bodies.
</output>
</example>

<example>
<input>Pasted: a `.mdc` file with `globs:` and `alwaysApply:` in frontmatter — "will this load in claude code?"</input>
<output>
1. Resolve: parse pasted content. Frontmatter: `description`, `globs`,
   `alwaysApply`. No `name` field.
2. Load providers list.
3. Fan out 4 parallel agents.
4. Verdicts:

   - Claude Code: **incompatible** — missing required `name` field; `skills`
     CLI rejects without it. `globs`/`alwaysApply` are silently ignored.
   - Cursor: **compatible** — this is native `.mdc` format.
   - Codex CLI: **partial** — Codex reads AGENTS.md as plain markdown;
     frontmatter is silently ignored, content would still apply.
   - Continue.dev: **partial** — move to `.continue/rules/<name>.md`;
     `globs` is supported, `alwaysApply` is not.

5. Recommend: add `name: <kebab-case>` to make portable; consider dropping
   `alwaysApply` since only Cursor honors it.
</output>
</example>

<example>
<good>
Ran `node scripts/providers.mjs --pretty` once at step 2 and passed the
result to all four subagents. Subagents WebFetch their own provider docs in
parallel.
</good>

<bad>
Hardcoded provider doc URLs into the SKILL.md body. When Cursor moved their
docs, the audit kept fetching a 404 page and reported "compatible" because
the verdict was based on stale information.
</bad>

The bad version violates the single-source-of-truth principle — provider
details belong in `scripts/providers.mjs`, never inlined into the audit
prompt.
