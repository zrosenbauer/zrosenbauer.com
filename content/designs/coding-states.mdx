# Background

I initially created these as banners for Spotify Playlists I created for coding, such as my "Angry" or "Focused" playlists. I unintentionally created a set of images that represent different "states of coding", or at least how I feel when I'm coding. 
As you can see in the images I'm wearing my favorite baseball cap, NYCFC (New York City Football Club), and my **I'm-too-lazy-to-pick-out-an-outfit-everyday** black t-shirt (I have a drawer full of them).

# The States

Below are the different states of coding, with a brief description of each (yes... I'm going to talk about "Zac" in the third person).

## angry

"Angry Zac" smashes the keyboard while listening to Death Metal.

## focused

"Focused Zac" put his headphones on but forgot to play music, because he's so focused (cough cough **ADHD**).

## energized

"Energized Zac" decided to drink a couple energy drinks (probably [Club Mates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate)).

## techno

"Techno Zac" is coding while listening to deadmau5 (probably has "while 1\<2" on repeat) music or something from Berlin.

## bierzeit

"Bierzeit Zac" is attempting to hit the [Ballmer Peak](https://xkcd.com/323/).

## broke prod

"Uh-oh, Broke Prod Zac" is trying to figure out the age-old-question: "But it worked on my machine..."
