The proverbial first program that every programmer writes.

```javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```

Well I probably used VBScript or something like that, but you get the idea.

## ðŸ¤¨ Who am I?

My name is Zac, and I've spent over a decade working in startups as a software engineer, manager, and executive.

My primary focus has been in three areas:

- **Node.js** - I started using Node.js back in 2015 and have been using it ever since. I've built a lot of APIs and services with Node.js & :heart: it.
- **React** - I had the pleasure of using `createReactClass` back in the day. So I've seen quite a bit of React.
- **DevOps** - being in startups meant that if we needed DevOps... it sort of just fell to me as the Head of Engineering so I learned a lot on the job. I also love building tools for developers, so DevOps was & has been a natural fit.

I've also had the opporunity to do some neat things such as:

- **Went through Techstars** in NYC, where I was able to learn from the best, such as David Cohen, a Co-founder at Digital Ocean and a Co-founder at GitHub.
- **Built a fraud detection system** at Precognitive.io that was used by Banks and E-Commerce companies.
- **Built & passed multiple SOC 2 & PCI certifications** at Precognitive.io, ShopRunner, and FedEx Dataworks.
- **Ran a large organization** at FedEx Dataworks, where I ran an organization of 100+ engineers, with 8 managers.

## ðŸ¤· Who cares?

Why am I telling you all this... because over the years I've been fortunate to work with some amazing people and build some great products.

I've also made a lot of mistakes along the way. My hope is that through my blog I can share some of the things
I've learned and help others avoid some of the mistakes I've made, or at least make new ones. ðŸ˜…
