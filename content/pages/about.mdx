## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Zac Rosenbauer. 

I've spent over a decade working in startups as a software engineer, manager, and executive. I've been fortunate to work with some amazing people and build some great products. 
I've also made a lot of mistakes along the way. My hope is that through my blog I can share some of the things I've learned and help others avoid some of the mistakes I've made, or at least make new ones. ðŸ˜…

## The Road so Far

I started out my career by starting a consulting agency, [PointStart](https://pointstart.io), (while still in college) that built websites and e-commerce integrations aka lots of Wordpress sites & stores. After PointStart shut down, because I didn't enjoy
building Wordpress sites, I joined [neighborhoods.com](https://neighborhoods.com) as the 2nd engineer, to build out their real estate platform.

I took my first stab at the pre-seed, super early startup world with [Precognitive](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/precognitive-inc) (acquired by ShopRunner) as the VP of Engineering. After we were acquired, I joined [ShopRunner](https://shoprunner.com) as the Head of Platform Engineering, where I helped build out
their platform engineering (aka DevOps) and fraud detection systems (cause of Precognitive). ShopRunner was acquired by FedEx in 2020 and I moved to a Director of Platform Engineering at [FedEx Dataworks](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/dataworks.html) where I ran an organization of 100+ engineers.

After a year at FedEx, I decided to leave and join a startup again, but this time I wanted to **start** the start-up (not intending to be punny). I started Joggr with my co-founder, [Seth](https://github.com/srosenbauer), in late 2022 to build a documentation platform that
developers would love and use everyday.

## What I'm up to now 

If you read the above, you'll know I'm currently the CTO of [Joggr](https://joggr.io), a startup that's building **the documentation platform for developers**. I also hack on some side projects, 
like this blog, and do some consulting when I can (I'm pretty time strapped with Joggr).

## The personal stuff

I live in New York City with my wife and dog, I train Krav Maga at least 2-3 times a week, and I try to travel as much as I can. If you want to get to know the country side of me (I was born and raised in rural Ohio ðŸŒ½) just ask me about tractor pulls.

If you want to chat about startups, software engineering, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to [me](/contact).
